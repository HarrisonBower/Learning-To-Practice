    <h1>Why Coding is a Muscle to Be Trained</h1>
    <p class="sub-heading">It just is. No explanation needed</p>

    <h2>It's Pretty Obvious</h2>
    <p>Ever heard the term "Use it or lose it"? Well that term is pretty accurate. Physically, If you fail to keep 
        your muscles trained and healthy by eating well and working out, eventually you will lose some strength. The same thing applies
        in sports with muscle memory. People describe themselves as "rusty" all the time. There is literally a coined phrase
        for being out of practice. If you work on a skil everyday, even just for 30 minutes, you will be able to improve that skill so much in such little time.
        On the flip side, however, if you sit around and don't work on your skills, you become out of touch with what you enjoy doing. On another side of the coin, technology is a quickly evolving world.
        If you stay too out of touch with programming, you won't just be behind on your skills as they are, but behind in industry standards as they are. 
        It's always a good idea to stay up to date with new languages, code lines, and anyting that can keep your knowledge fresh and healthy.
