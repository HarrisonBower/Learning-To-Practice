<h2>How Does Your Brain Work?</h2>
  <p>You've heard of multitasking and all the benefits of it. What you may not know
    is that there is no such thing as multitasking. At least not in the sense that you can put 100% of your 
    energy into two seperate tasks. Why do I bring this up? Multitasking (for the sake of this article) is more the idea of being able to focus
    on working through something, and having something goin in the background to rein in productivity. However,
    not everyone is capable of this.
  </p>
  <p>Personally, I listen to music that is relaxing and doesn't have words, and therefore my brain doesn't try to jump to other things randomly.
    My favorite genre of music when I am working is LoFi hiphop. When my brain hears it, I am able to focus and 
    work productively because it does to things for me.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>It helps drown out any conversation around me or just general noise that might take my brain on the railroad 
        of rabbit holes and distractions. 
    </li>
    <li>The second thing it does for me is relaxes my mind so I myself am not keeping myself from my work. I haven't looked into 
        it at all, but LoFi genuinely calms my brain down and lets me get into a workflow that typically
        I am unable to achieve. Maybe it's just me, but maybe there's a science behind it.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Knowing my side of things now, maybe you should go and try to find some music that your brain can use to 
    start a productive workflow and can keep you from getting too distracted. Maybe it will work, maybe it won't. But, you should 
    definitely give it a shot next time you are sitting down to work on something.
