    <h2>What Now?</h2>
    <p>Honestly, I spent the better art of 5 hours writing this up, and I'm not sure
        there's anything more boring I could have done. HOWEVER. I did learn some things. As of right now, this is live on a public 
        GitHub repository. However, what is live only has as far as the second page finished. So when I finish this, I will go update that and it will be complete. 
        I'll put the things I learned from this in a list (becasue why not?)
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>I learned how to navigate GitHub a little better.</li>
        <li>I learned a pseudo target for CSS that lets me change the color
            of a hyper link when the mouse is hovering over it.
        </li>
        <li>I learned a better way to organize files within the root folder of a website,
            and I'm sure I will learn more as my sites get more and more complicated.
        </li>
        <li>I learned how to make my workflow a little bit more efficient through the accidental learning of quick keys and 
            key functions.
        </li>
    </ul>
