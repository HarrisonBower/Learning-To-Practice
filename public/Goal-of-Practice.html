  <h1>The Goal of Practice</h1>
    <p>And why it really is super important</p>
<hr />

<h2>Part One: What is Practice?</h2>
    <p class="explanation">Practice is the action of learning something and repeatedly pushing yourself
        to putting your ability to retain that information. When practicing, you should
        always go about it in two sections.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Work on new topics and test your understanding of those things</li>
          <li>Practice prior topics and make sure that your understanding of those topics
            is proper and, if not, research an idea to understand it deeper
          </li>
        </ol>
    <p>Beyond this, the ultimate goal of practice is to build muscle memory in your field, 
        but also to make sure that you are accurately and efficiently understanding everything
        that you are doing. That way, when issues and problems arise, you have the tools
        to go about a process of troubleshooting.
    </p>
<h2>Part Two: Applying Practice in Coding</h2>  
    <p>Coding is a huge world to take on. There are literally dozens and dozens
        and dozens of languages you could learn. They all kind of do the same thing,
        yet the syntax for each is something that will ruin a program or website if applied 
        inaccurately. So how do we practice to code well? (This can apply outside
        of programming as well.) Let's apply the tips from above to this.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Work on new topics and test your understanding of those things
            <ul>
                <li>Like I said above, there are many programming languages and understanding the syntax for 
                    each is is simple if you practice often. Take this document for example. This is a practice
                    for me, and the goal of this is to compile all the skills I've learned in the last couple
                    of weeks into a single document to stretch my ability to build a website. This is including
                    HTML and some very Basic CSS coding, so I can grow in my ability to code without
                    needing a lesson a specific exercise to work on it.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Practice prior topics and make sure that your understanding of those topics
            is proper and, if not, research an idea to understand it deeper
            <ul>
                <li>I am using coding practices I am very familiar with to build this site. HTML, some simple CSS, and organization
                    within the code. This is an example of practicing what I already do now to 
                    keep it fresh in my mind. However, I also wanted to push myself and learn somehting
                    new to add into the document. To achieve this, I attempted to stretch my CSS knoweldge by changing the color of a hyperlink
                    that has been clicked on. I used sources such as Google and ChatGPT to learn what code needs to be written,
                    and how it should be formatted to succeed in that. I am new to CSS, but have been able to learn just thorugh
                    my own curiosity and using the internet to push me in the right direction.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>As you can see, practice can be an extremely powerful tool if used often and well.</p>
