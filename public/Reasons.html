<h1>What Are Some Reasons to Practice?</h1>
  <p class="sub-heading">I mean so many. But here are a few key reasons.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Part One: Motivation</h2>
  <p>Before we can talk about why we should practice our skills, let's talk about the foundation of it all.
    In order to want to work on what we love, we need motivation. I'll give an example. I love to golf, and I 
    feel like I am pretty good for only having played for a year. But if you put me up against a pro like Tiger Woods or 
    Bryson DeChambeau, I'm going to get crushed. Why? because they practice every single day, and have been (in Tiger's case) for 30+ years.
    So what is my motivation to continnue? well two things really. One is i just really enjoy the sport and want to see myself improve.
    The second is that it's a hobby sport that I like to share with my father in law, friends, and other family members. Everyone I play with is better than me 
    (for now) and that pushes me to be better so I can play alongside them better.
  </p>
  <p>So where can we find the motivation to practice our skills? There are 3 points that help us find and define this motivation.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Why am I interested in this in the first? In other words, what drove me to 
        do what I am doing now?
    </li>
    <li>Who am I benefitting? Are there people gaining from this that I can use to help motivate myself?</li>
    <li>And finally, how am I able to better myself through my own work? Do I have the discipline to work hard even when I really don't want to?
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>We can look at these all in depth and sift through to find the motivation to continue on.
    To make this easy, I'm going to use my own love for programming to answer these questions.
  </p>
  <p>To answer the first question, I'll examine my history with programming. Keep in mind, I am about a month in, so I really don't have much!
    My last job was with a corporate AV company. All the things that I loved about working there are similar within coding. All the things I didn't like 
    are not present in coding. I love putting things together, I love working with clients to make their ideas come to life, and I love finding solutions to issues I am facing.
    However, I don't like an inconsistent work life balance, I don't like having to add an hour and a half to my day just for a commute, and I don't like working in the same 
    work environment all the time. You know, sometimes I just need to change it up. When I got to the end of my wit, I decided to jump into programming because so many peope 
    who knew me pretty well told me it would be perfect for me.
  </p>
<p>Let's move to the second question. Mainly, I am benefitting clients. People who I hope to build good relationships with that can be a returning player
  in my work life. In everything I do, I aim to have the end product fill all the wishes of my client and more. Not just in AV. But when I worked at coffeeshops, and now
  as I work in the world of programming and web development. If my clients are happy, I can find myself loving what I do more and more everyday I do it.
</p>
<p>Final Question. How can I better myself through this? Well, we can look at this question through a couple different lenses. A subsequent question here could be "Is this really what I love?".
  Because if it's not, the discipline will never build itself. So; how do I better myself through this? The first way I would answer this is in the way that I go about my job. If I come across a problem,
  I am reaching out to people for help. Looking at forums, chatting with people online who may have had similar problems in the past. I am doing the work to learn from and overcome my problems. The second
  lens is this: Am I willing to put in the extra time and work if a deadline is approaching and I am not in the spot I would hope to be on the project? The answer should always be yes, but sometimes it's just not. 
  This is where discipline is so important. Being able to look at the situation and know that it needs to get done, and that if it doesn't it will affect my life in a plethera of ways I do not want.
</p>
<h2>Part Two: Letting the Motivation Push You to Learn</h2>
<p>Similar to above, if I am motivated to do what I love, I will be equally motivated to improve. And this is where the practice conversation comes full circle. I am always looking to work on 
  improving what I already know, and adding things that I do not know. Ways to tak emy web design to the next level. This also brings its own motivation, because now I have a new tool in the bag to use. Again, this whole website is a practice for me. 
  I'm pretending to write out this whole website, but really I'm just trying to give mysef content to work with and practice on. I'm simulating what it will be like to program a website in the real world and 
  using what I know to get it done, but learning something I don't to make it just a little bit more impressive. When practicing, you should do the same. Always strive to learn anything you can to just be a little bit better today at what you do than you were yesterday.
