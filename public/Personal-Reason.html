    <h2>Practice.</h2>
    <p>This whole document has been a practicing document for me. The constant repeated use of H1, H2, p, and many other 
        elements within HTML. Learning the doctype statement through repeated use. I'll go into all this a little later.
        I did this for me, but hopefully (if there is anybody reading this) You were able to get something from this too.
